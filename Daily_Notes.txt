    ]
  }
]
// //console.log(objNew);
// const updateMyObj = {...objNew,completed:"false",day:"tuesday"};   // means convert your array of objects into a object type
// console.log(updateMyObj);  // O/P = object
function getObject(id){
  return objNew.find((d) => d.id === id)
}
const temp = getObject(1);
const updateTemp = {...temp,title:"Web 3",completed:"false"};
console.log(updateTemp);
